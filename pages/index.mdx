- I am a Senior Software Engineer with **over 11 years** of professional experience
- I have honed my craft working with a diverse array of entities, from multinational corporations in Europe to leading
  teams in startups in South Africa to domestic companies in the United States.
- As a seasoned React Native developer, I have contributed to the development of numerous applications, from ideation
to publication on the AppStore and PlayStore, while providing continuous on-call support, hyper-care, and managing
client communications.
- My day-to-day responsibilities include designing and implementing new features, as well as maintaining and improving
existing codebases, mentoring and coaching my peers, conducting pair-programming sessions, scrutinizing Pull Requests,
troubleshooting long-running technical issues, writing + debugging iOS/Android code, patching third-party libraries,
and, of course, fulfilling my other daily responsibilities.
- I rely heavily on team communication and collaboration and as such, I am a strong advocate for Agile methodologies and
best practices.  Normally, I would choose what works best for the team, but I am also comfortable with the Waterfall
methodology or adhere to the company's convention.
- I make sure that all of my work is thoroughly tested and documented, and I am a stickler for code quality and
maintainability.  I am also a strong proponent of continuous integration and unit testing.
- Throughout the Software Development Lifecycle, I make sure that all stakeholders are kept in the loop and that all
requirements are met.  I am also a strong advocate for the use of design patterns and best practices.
- Although, I do have my preferences, I am comfortable working with a variety of technologies, including React Native,
React, Redux, Redux-Saga, Redux-Thunk, NextJS, NodeJS, etc... The list goes on.  I am betting on my skills as a
Software Engineer and as such, I am always willing to learn new tech stacks and adopt new methodologies of work based
on the employer principles/strategies.
- I take great pride in my contributions to humanitarian efforts, as my work has saved the lives of over 124,000 individuals
from war-ravaged countries. Additionally, I am gratified to have had a role in the rewrite of the chat application
utilized by the team at NASA.
- I am enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities as a React Native Developer, and I am eager to expand my skill set
to include full-stack development.
- Coming from a rich background in Software Engineering, I breathe life into mobile apps through ingenuity, passion,
experience, best practices, and dedication.
